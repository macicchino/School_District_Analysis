# School_District_Analysis

Module 4 Challenge: Michael Cicchino

### Summary of Data  
In reviewing the data, two data comparisons stood out. First, the budget for public schools is higher than charter schools. Second, charter schools outperform public schools in math and reading. Using only these two comparisons, one may imply there is an inverse relation between budgets and academic performance. However, this would be pre-mature. I I believe comparing the total student count between Public and Charter schools, could shed more light on the relationship to school performance. 
Perhaps other statistics, such as 'Average Classroom' size could be pulled and analyzed as well. 


#### Discoveries from Process
During the process of reviewing the data, it became clear there was multiple approaches for collecting the data. In the future, using alternate logic will be an important tool for quality control and testing.
